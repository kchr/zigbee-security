# Api-do: Tools for ZigBee and 802.15.4 Security Auditing

Project homepage for the ZigBee/802.15.4 security research at the Dartmouth
Trust Lab, which is under the umbrella project name of Api-do.

## Overview

The goal is to produce methods and tools for accessing security of ZigBee and
other IEEE 802.15.4 deployments and/or implementations. Specifically, we seek to
advance the state-of-the-art in device discovery and enumeration, geographical
mapping, fingerprinting, and exploitation, while providing recommendations for
remediation.

Api-do is a collection of tools inspired by and extending Joshua Wright's
original KillerBee. It is a martial art aspect of ZigBee networking
[apiculture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beekeeping): the Way of the Bee.

“Security will not get better until tools for practical exploration of the
attack surface are made available.” ("Wright's law", [Joshua Wright](http://www.willhackforsushi.com/))

“It is hard to overemphasize the importance of penetration testing in the
overall information security structure and the value of viewing your network
through the cracker's eyes prior to further hardening procedures” **(Wi-Foo: The Secrets of Wireless Hacking, 20)**
